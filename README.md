## Project 14

"In this project we’re going to build an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

To make all that work will mean leveraging some skills you’ve met already, such as forms, sheets, `Codable`, and `URLSession`, but also teach you some new skills: how to embed maps in a SwiftUI app, how to store private data safely so that only an authenticated user can access it, how to load and save data outside of UserDefaults, and more."
