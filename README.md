## Project 14

Source URL: [Bucket List: Introduction](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/books/ios-swiftui/bucket-list-introduction)

"In this project we’re going to build an app that lets the user build a private list of places on the map that they intend to visit one day, add a description for that place, look up interesting places that are nearby, and save it all to the iOS storage for later.

To make all that work will mean leveraging some skills you’ve met already, such as forms, sheets, `Codable`, and `URLSession`, but also teach you some new skills: how to embed maps in a SwiftUI app, how to store private data safely so that only an authenticated user can access it, how to load and save data outside of `UserDefaults`, and more."

### Adding user locations to a map

"This project is going to be based around a map view, asking users to add places to the map that they want to visit. To do that we need to place a `Map` so that it takes up our whole view, track its annotations, and also whether or not the user is viewing place details.

We’re going to start with a full-screen `Map` view, giving it an initial position."
